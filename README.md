This Java file was one of my first projects. The goal was to create a project that calculates how many people are dining in and how much the total price would be. 
For example, if three people were dining in then the total price would be $105. This project helped me strengthen my skills to create prompts to get information from 
the user and helped me create methods to calculate and output the price for the user. Although it is a very simple project this was the first project that made me feel like a software
developer.
